# Kasiṇa discs

Kasiṇa (Pāli: कसिण) are a visual meditation object in the Buddhist traditions. 
This page shows a selection of traditional colored kasina discs, and also: earth, moon and sun.  You can use them however you like.

## Sources

* The earth imagery is from [NASA EPIC](https://epic.gsfc.nasa.gov/), which sits at the [L1 point](https://www.nesdis.noaa.gov/content/points-lagrange-satellite-million-miles-home) between the Earth and Sun, and captures a midday picture of the planet approximately every two hours.  The image displayed is typically 24 or 48 hours old, the closest to "time of day".

* The moon image is a simulation from [NASA SVS](https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/4768), showing the current moon phase.  It should appear accurate for your current latitude.

* The sun image is from [NASA SDO](https://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/), and shows a near-realtime view from geosynchonous Earth orbit.  The 'intensitygram' usually shows sunspots clearly.

## Meditation

Duncan's [Commentary on the Vimuttimagga](https://firekasina.org/2015/04/03/commentary-on-the-vimuttimagga/)
explains the meditation technique.  Alternatively, there is a slightly longer [instruction by Thitapuñño Bhikkhu](http://www.elixa.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Color-Kasina-Meditation-By-Thitapun%CC%83n%CC%83o-Bhikkhu.pdf).

Kasina meditation can have intense psychological and emotional effects.  It is strongly recommended to work with an experienced teacher.
